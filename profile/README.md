The [Eclipse Lyo](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.lyo) project is focused on 
providing an SDK to enable adoption of [OSLC specifications](https://open-services.net/). 
OSLC (Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration) is an open community dedicated to reducing 
barriers for lifecycle tool integration. The community authors specifications for exposing 
lifecycle artifacts through uniform (REST) interfaces and relying on Internet and Linked Data
standards.


You can find more resources for developing OSLC applications with Lyo, under the 
[OSLC Developer Guide](https://oslc.github.io/developing-oslc-applications/eclipse_lyo/eclipse-lyo.html).
You are welcome to post questions on the [OSLC forum](https://forum.open-services.net/c/sdks/lyo/9).


The [OLSLC OP Reference implementation](https://github.com/OSLC/refimpl) repository contains 
sample code that demonstrates how to build OSLC servers for various domains.
